# SynnixOS

Epic Hobby OS targeting x86_64 CPUs, it includes some hacked together functionality for most essential OSs although, it doesn't have proper screen support :sweat_smile:

I mean you can have a nosy around here if you'd like to. I'm only writing this because this repo needs some info on it.

This place has some juicy code about most topics in OSDev.
